# Spatial and Temporal Synchronization for Multi-Source PBF-LB/M Data

## Abstract

Powder Bed Fusion - Laser Beam/Metal (PBF-LB/M) additive manufacturing integrates data from multiple sources—hatching paths, laser parameters, in-situ process monitoring (ISPM), and computed tomography (CT) scans—each with different coordinate systems, temporal references, and spatial resolutions. Without alignment, fusion, signal mapping, and quality assessment are ill-defined: "same location" and "same layer" cannot be consistently interpreted across sources. This paper presents the **design and rationale for spatial and temporal synchronization** that must be performed **before** any downstream analysis. We argue for a **point-first pipeline**: transform point coordinates before voxelization, using **bounding-box corner correspondence** only (no point-to-point matching). Spatial alignment fits a similarity transform (Kabsch + Umeyama) from 8 bbox corners per source by trying 24 rotational permutations and 56 triplets per permutation, selecting the fit with smallest max error on all 8 corners, and validating with an adaptive tolerance (1% of bbox extent). Temporal alignment provides consistent layer/time mapping and point-based temporal alignment so that per-layer fusion and time-window analysis are well-defined across sources. We compare our approach to grid-based alignment and RANSAC/point-matching alternatives, and show that point-first alignment avoids resampling artifacts, preserves precision, and uses full data extent by default for stable transforms. The pipeline is implemented in C++ with Python bindings; the main entry point is `UnifiedQueryClient.query_and_transform_points`. Results demonstrate sub-voxel alignment accuracy, robust validation, and correct behaviour across multi-source PBF-LB/M datasets. This paper establishes the foundation upon which signal mapping (Paper 1), analysis (Paper 2), and industrial application (Paper 3) rely.
