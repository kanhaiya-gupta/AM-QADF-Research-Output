# Unified Voxel Domain Signal Mapping for Multi-Source PBF-LB/M Process Data

## Abstract

Powder Bed Fusion - Laser Beam/Metal (PBF-LB/M) additive manufacturing generates massive, heterogeneous datasets from multiple sources including hatching paths, laser parameters, computed tomography (CT) scans, and in-situ process monitoring systems, including melt pool monitoring (MPM). Each data source operates in different coordinate systems, temporal resolutions, and spatial formats, making unified analysis and digital quality assessment challenging. This paper presents a **signal mapping framework** for **temporal and spatial segmentation** of process and monitoring data that transforms heterogeneous point-based data from multiple sources into a unified 3D voxel domain representation, enabling comprehensive multi-source data integration and analysis for digital quality assessment of additively manufactured metallic aircraft components.

The framework consists of five key components: (1) a NoSQL data warehouse architecture (extended from existing backend) using MongoDB and GridFS for flexible storage of multi-source PBF-LB/M data including ISPM and CT datasets, (2) a signal mapping engine that performs coordinate system transformation, voxel grid generation with spatially and temporally variable resolution, and signal interpolation using four implemented methods (nearest neighbor, linear, inverse distance weighted, and Gaussian kernel density estimation), (3) a calibration and correction framework that handles systematic errors, geometric distortions, and sensor biases through reference-based calibration, distortion correction models (scaling, rotation, warping), and correction validation, with flexible application at different stages (typically pre-mapping, with optional post-mapping, pre-fusion, or post-fusion corrections as needed), (4) data synchronization algorithms for temporal and spatial alignment, handling geometric distortions and noise, and (5) clients for targeted evaluation and visualization of voxel domain data with an interactive analysis framework.

The signal mapping process transforms point clouds with hundreds of thousands of coordinates into structured voxel grids, achieving significant data volume reduction while preserving spatial relationships. The framework supports uniform, adaptive, and multi-resolution voxel grids, enabling variable resolution based on data density and analysis requirements. The framework handles a comprehensive catalog of signals including laser parameters (power, speed, energy density), path geometry (hatch spacing, overlap percentage), layer parameters (layer thickness), scan strategy parameters, thermal signals (melt pool temperature, cooling rate, temperature gradient), and quality metrics (density, porosity, defect information). A `data_index` mapping mechanism enables direct one-to-one mapping between hatching path segments and the laser parameter measurements that were used to execute those segments, facilitating comparison between planned and actual process parameters. Results demonstrate successful integration of hatching paths, laser parameters, CT scans, and ISPM monitoring data into a unified representation, enabling downstream applications including data fusion, quality assessment, statistical analysis, anomaly detection, sensitivity analysis, and virtual experiments. The framework provides a foundation for comprehensive PBF-LB/M process analysis and quality control.
