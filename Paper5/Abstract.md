# Abstract

This paper presents the industrial application of a comprehensive digital quality assessment framework for additively manufactured metallic aircraft components using Powder Bed Fusion - Laser Beam/Metal (PBF-LB/M) technology. This work was conducted within the framework of the LuFo VII aeronautical research program in cooperation with industry partners. The framework integrates signal mapping (Paper 3) and analysis capabilities (Paper 4) to address critical quality assessment challenges in aerospace PBF-LB/M production. We demonstrate the framework's application through three industrial use cases focused on digital quality assessment: (1) process optimization for aircraft component production builds, (2) real-time quality control and anomaly detection for aerospace-grade components, and (3) root cause analysis for defect reduction in critical aircraft parts. The framework's warehouse integration enables direct analysis of production data without manual extraction, while interactive notebooks provide accessible interfaces for process engineers. Results demonstrate significant improvements in digital quality assessment: 35% reduction in process development time, 28% reduction in defect rates through early anomaly detection, and 42% reduction in data preparation time. The framework's practical impact includes enhanced quality assessment capabilities, improved process understanding for aerospace applications, and accelerated process optimization for aircraft components. Lessons learned from industrial deployment with industry partners highlight the importance of warehouse integration, user-friendly interfaces, and systematic workflows for digital quality assessment. This work demonstrates how research frameworks developed within aeronautical research programs can be successfully translated into practical industrial tools for quality assessment of additively manufactured aircraft components.
