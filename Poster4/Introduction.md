# Introduction

## Background

The unified voxel domain representation (from Paper 3) enables comprehensive analysis of multi-source PBF-LB/M data. However, transforming data is only the first step—the real value lies in the **analysis capabilities** that the unified representation enables.

## Problem Statement

While the unified voxel domain provides the foundation, several challenges remain:

- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Existing tools require manual data extraction
- **Virtual Experiments**: No integration with historical warehouse data
- **Anomaly Detection**: Limited spatial-temporal capabilities
- **Accessibility**: Advanced methods require programming expertise

## Our Solution

**Comprehensive Analysis Framework** integrating:

- ✅ **12 Sensitivity Analysis Methods**: Sobol, Morris, FAST, RBD, Delta, PAWN, DGSM, Local methods, Monte Carlo, Bayesian
- ✅ **10 Virtual Experiment Design Types**: LHS, Factorial, Response Surface, Optimal designs
- ✅ **18 Anomaly Detection Methods**: Statistical, Clustering, ML-based, Rule-based
- ✅ **Warehouse Integration**: Direct querying, automatic parameter extraction
- ✅ **Interactive Tools**: 7 Jupyter notebooks with widget-based interfaces

## Key Innovation

Seamless integration between analysis methods and NoSQL data warehouse, enabling direct analysis without manual data preparation.
