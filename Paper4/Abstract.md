# Abstract

The unified voxel domain representation created through signal mapping (Paper 3) enables comprehensive analysis of multi-source PBF-LB/M data. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis framework that leverages the unified voxel domain to provide advanced analysis capabilities including sensitivity analysis, virtual experiments, anomaly detection, and multi-signal fusion. The framework integrates 12 sensitivity analysis methods (Sobol, Morris, FAST, RBD, Delta, PAWN, DGSM, local methods, Monte Carlo, Bayesian), 10 virtual experiment design types (LHS, factorial, response surface, optimal designs), and 8+ anomaly detection methods (statistical, clustering, machine learning-based) with the NoSQL data warehouse.

The analysis framework provides seamless integration between the data warehouse and analysis methods, enabling direct querying of process variables and measurement outputs for sensitivity analysis, systematic virtual experiment design using warehouse parameter ranges, and spatial-temporal anomaly detection in the unified voxel domain. Results demonstrate successful application of sensitivity analysis to identify key process variables influencing quality outcomes, virtual experiment design for process optimization, and anomaly detection for early identification of process issues. The framework includes seven interactive Jupyter notebooks with widget-based interfaces, enabling non-programmers to perform advanced analysis without coding. The comprehensive analysis capabilities provide a foundation for process understanding, optimization, and quality control in PBF-LB/M additive manufacturing.
