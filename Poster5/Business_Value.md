## Cost Savings

### Annual Cost Savings: $312,000/year

#### 1. Scrap and Rework Reduction
- **Baseline**: 12% scrap rate
- **After Framework**: 8.6% scrap rate
- **Cost per Part**: $5,000 average
- **Monthly Production**: 50 parts
- **Monthly Savings**: (12% - 8.6%) × 50 × $5,000 = **$8,500/month**
- **Annual Savings**: **~$102,000/year**

#### 2. Process Development Time Reduction
- **Time Savings**: 35% reduction (2-3 weeks per development cycle)
- **Development Cycles**: 4 per year
- **Engineer Cost**: $150/hour
- **Annual Savings**: 2.5 weeks × 4 cycles × 40 hours/week × $150/hour = **$60,000/year**

#### 3. Data Preparation Time Reduction
- **Time Savings**: 85-90% (2-3 hours per build)
- **Builds per Month**: 50
- **Analyst Cost**: $100/hour
- **Monthly Savings**: 2.5 hours × 50 builds × $100/hour = **$12,500/month**
- **Annual Savings**: **~$150,000/year**
