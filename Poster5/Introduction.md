# Introduction

## Research Context

This work was conducted within the framework of the **LuFo VII (Luftfahrtforschungsprogramm VII) aeronautical research program**, focusing on **digital quality assessment of additively manufactured metallic aircraft components** in cooperation with industry partners.

## Industrial Challenge

Aerospace PBF-LB/M operations face critical challenges:

- **Strict Quality Standards**: Aerospace certification requirements (FAA, EASA)
- **Multi-Source Data**: Hatching, laser, CT, ISPM data in different formats
- **Real-Time Quality Control**: Need for early defect detection
- **Process Optimization**: Systematic parameter optimization required
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify causes of recurring defects

## Framework Application

The comprehensive framework (Papers 1 & 2) was deployed in industrial aerospace production:

- **Signal Mapping** (Paper 3): Unified voxel domain representation
- **Analysis Framework** (Paper 4): 40 analysis methods with warehouse integration
- **Industrial Deployment**: Real-world application in aircraft component production

## Objectives

Demonstrate practical value through three industrial use cases:

1. **Process Optimization**: Digital quality assessment for aircraft component process development
2. **Quality Control**: Real-time digital quality assessment and anomaly detection
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Digital quality assessment for defect reduction
